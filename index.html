    <p>Tic-tac-toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game typically played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns marking spaces with either an "X" or an "O" until one player successfully aligns three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until all spaces on the grid are filled, resulting in a draw. It's a simple yet engaging game commonly played by children and adults alike. Due to its simplicity and strategic elements, it's often used as a teaching tool for basic game theory and artificial intelligence concepts.</p>
